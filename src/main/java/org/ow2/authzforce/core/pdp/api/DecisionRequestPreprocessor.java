/**
 * XACML Decision Request pre-processor; applies some validation and processing of the input request prior to the policy evaluation. For example, a request preprocessor may transform an XACML Request
 * using the Multiple Decision Profile (section 2) into multiple Individual Decision Requests; and so that the policy evaluation engine is called for each Individual Decision Request. At the end, the
 * results (one per Individual Decision Request) may be combined by a {@link DecisionResultPostprocessor}.
 * <p>
 * PDP extensions of this type (to support new ways of pre-processing XACML decision requests) must implement the {@link Factory} class
 * <p>
 * Note: this interface is meant to be generic enough to be independent of the actual original input data format (XML, JSON...).
 * 
 * @param <OUTPUT_INDIVIDUAL_DECISION_REQUEST>

 * @param <INPUT_DECISION_REQUEST>
 *            type of original input decision request that may correspond to multiple individual decision requests (e.g. using XACML Multiple Decision Profile). Usually serializable, e.g.
 *            XACML-schema-derived JAXB Request for XML.
