/**
 * XACML Request filter; applies some validation and processing of the input request prior to the policy evaluation. A typical request filter may support the
 * MultiRequests element, and more generally the Multiple Decision Profile by creating multiple Individual Decision Requests (EvaluationContext) from the
 * original XACML request, as defined in XACML Multiple Decision Profile specification, section 2; and then call the policy evaluation engine for each
 * Individual Decision Request. At the end, the results (one per Individual Decision Request) may be combined by a {@link DecisionResultFilter}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This replaces and supersedes the former, now obsolete, ResourceProvider, which used to correspond to one mode of the Multiple Decision Profile for requesting
 * multiple decisions.
