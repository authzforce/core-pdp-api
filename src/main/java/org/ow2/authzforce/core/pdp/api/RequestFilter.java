/**
 * XACML Request filter; applies some validation and processing of the input request prior to the policy evaluation. A typical request filter may support the MultiRequests element, and more generally
 * the Multiple Decision Profile by creating multiple Individual Decision Requests (EvaluationContext) from the original XACML request, as defined in XACML Multiple Decision Profile specification,
 * section 2; and then call the policy evaluation engine for each Individual Decision Request. At the end, the results (one per Individual Decision Request) may be combined by a
 * {@link DecisionResultFilter}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This replaces and supersedes the former, now obsolete, ResourceProvider, which used to correspond to one mode of the Multiple Decision Profile for requesting multiple decisions.
