 * Policy Element evaluator interface, "Policy Element" referring to all Policy* element: Policy, PolicySet, PolicyIdReference (handled by PolicyReference),
 * PolicySetIdReference (handled by PolicySetReference). All these classes have common behavior which is captured by this interface to benefit from
 * polymorphism, therefore more reusable (-> less) code. Actually this class intends to replace AbstractPolicy which can no longer be used as mother class to
 * (xacmlv3.)Policy(Set) and Policy(Set)Reference (because it is an abstract class), as long as those classes already extend another class from JAXB model (e.g.
 * com.thalesgroup.authzforce.core.test.custom.Policy extends oasis.names...Policy), so we can only make them implement an Interface instead, as Java does not
 * allow extension of multiple abstract classes.
